## Step 2: Configuring BYOVA and BYODS

### 2.1 Understanding BYOVA and BYODS

- **BYOVA (Bring Your Own Virtual Agent)**: Allows you to integrate external AI services as virtual agents
- **BYODS (Bring Your Own Data Source)**: Enables integration with external data sources for enhanced AI capabilities
  - BYOVA builds on top of the BYODS framework
  - Provides secure, standardized data exchange between Webex and third-party providers
  - Uses JWS (JSON Web Signature) tokens for authentication
  - Requires Service App creation and admin authorization

**Important**: BYOVA requires BYODS setup first, as the virtual agent configuration depends on having a registered data source.

### 2.2 Create a Service App for BYODS

Before configuring BYOVA, we need to set up a Service App for data source integration, as BYOVA builds on top of the BYODS (Bring Your Own Data Source) framework.

1. **Navigate to Webex Developer Portal**
   - Go to [developer.webex.com](https://developer.webex.com)
   - Sign in with your Webex account

2. **Create a New Service App**
   - Go to **My Apps** → **Create a New App**
   - Choose **Service App** as the application type

3. **Configure the Service App**
   - **Name**: `BYOVA Gateway Service App` (or your preferred name)
   - **Scopes**: Ensure you select:
     - `spark-admin:datasource_read`
     - `spark-admin:datasource_write`
   - **Domains**: Specify your gateway domain (e.g., `your-domain.com` or `ngrok-free.app`)
     - Avoid registering ports in the domain - all ports will be accepted later
   - **Data Exchange Schema**: Select `VA_service_schema` for voice virtual agent interactions
     - This schema (ID: `5397013b-7920-4ffc-807c-e8a3e0a18f43`) is specifically designed for voice virtual agent services
     - Reference: [VoiceVirtualAgent Schema](https://github.com/webex/dataSourceSchemas/tree/v1.10/Services/VoiceVirtualAgent/5397013b-7920-4ffc-807c-e8a3e0a18f43)
   
   - Complete any other required information

4. **Save the Service App Client ID and Client Secret**
   - Under **Authentication**, locate the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
   - Save these credentials for later use

5. **Submit for Admin Approval**
   - In your sandbox, select **"Request Admin Approval"**
   - This makes the Service App visible in Control Hub for admin authorization

### 2.3 Register Your Data Source

1. **Get Admin Authorization**
   - In Control Hub (admin.webex.com), navigate to **Apps** → **Service Apps**
   - Find your Service App and click **"Authorize"**
   - This generates org-specific access and refresh tokens

2. **Get Service App Token**
   - After admin approval, return to [developer.webex.com](https://developer.webex.com)
   - Go to **My Apps** and select your Service App
   - Under **Org Authorizations**, locate your org in the list and select it
   - Paste the **Client Secret** from step 1 into the **Client Secret** field and click **"Generate Tokens"**
   - Save the returned `access_token` - you'll need it to register your data source
   - Note: Tokens expire and will need to be refreshed using the refresh token provided

3. **Register the Data Source**
   - Use the access token from step 1 to register your data source
   - Make a POST request to `/v1/datasources` with the following payload:
   - **API Reference**: [Register a Data Source](https://developer.webex.com/admin/docs/api/v1/data-sources/register-a-data-source)

   ```json
   {
     "schemaId": "5397013b-7920-4ffc-807c-e8a3e0a18f43",
     "url": "https://your-gateway-ip:50051",
     "audience": "BYOVAGateway",
     "subject": "callAudioData",
     "nonce": "123456",
     "tokenLifeMinutes": "1440"
   }
   ```

   - Save the data source ID for later use

**Reference**: For detailed BYODS setup instructions, see the [Bring Your Own Data Source documentation](https://developer.webex.com/create/docs/bring-your-own-datasource).

   - The entry point will now route calls through your virtual agent integration

---

## Step 3: Testing with Local Audio Connector

Before setting up AWS Lex, let's test the BYOVA integration using the local audio connector. This allows you to verify that your BYOVA configuration is working correctly with pre-recorded audio files.

### 3.1 Configure the Local Audio Connector

1. **Update Gateway Configuration**
   - Edit `config/config.yaml` to ensure the local audio connector is enabled
   - The local connector should already be configured by default:

   ```yaml
   connectors:
     local_audio_connector:
       type: "local_audio_connector"
       class: "LocalAudioConnector"
       module: "connectors.local_audio_connector"
       config:
         audio_files:
           welcome: "welcome.wav"
           transfer: "transferring.wav"
           goodbye: "goodbye.wav"
           error: "error.wav"
           default: "default_response.wav"
         agents:
           - "Local Playback"
   ```

2. **Prepare Audio Files**
   - Ensure audio files are in the `audio/` directory
   - Default files should already be present:
     - `welcome.wav` - Welcome message
     - `default_response.wav` - Response messages
     - `goodbye.wav` - Goodbye message
     - `transferring.wav` - Transfer message
     - `error.wav` - Error message

### 3.2 Start the Gateway

1. **Activate Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Start the Gateway**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Verify Startup**
   - Check that both gRPC server (port 50051) and web interface (port 8080) are running
   - Access the monitoring interface at `http://localhost:8080`

### 3.3 Test the Local Connector

1. **Make a Test Call**
   - Call the entrypoint number from your sandbox provisioning email
   - You should hear the welcome message from the local audio connector

2. **Verify Audio Playback**
   - The local connector will play the configured audio files
   - Check the monitoring interface for active connections
   - Review logs to ensure proper audio file playback

3. **Test Flow Integration**
   - Verify the call flows through your imported BYOVA flow
   - Test different scenarios (welcome, responses, goodbye)
   - Ensure proper call termination

### 3.4 Troubleshoot Local Connector Issues

**Common Issues:**
- **No Audio**: Check that audio files exist in the `audio/` directory
- **Wrong Audio**: Verify audio file names match the configuration
- **Connection Issues**: Ensure the gateway is accessible from Webex Contact Center

**Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Check gateway status
curl http://localhost:8080/api/status

# View available agents
curl http://localhost:8080/api/agents

# Check active connections
curl http://localhost:8080/api/connections
```

Once the local connector is working correctly, you can proceed to set up AWS Lex for more sophisticated voice AI interactions.

## Step 4: Setting Up AWS Lex

### 4.1 Create an AWS account

If you already have an AWS account, skip this step. If you don't have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one.

1. Open https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup.

2. Follow the online instructions. Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call or text message and entering a verification code on the phone keypad.

   When you sign up for an AWS account, an AWS account root user is created. The root user has access to all AWS services and resources in the account. As a security best practice, assign administrative access to a user, and use only the root user to perform tasks that require root user access.

### 4.2 Create Your AWS Lex Bot

You can create a bot with Amazon Lex V2 in multiple ways. If you want to learn more about all the ways, refer to [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/create-bot.html) guide.

In this section, you create an Amazon Lex bot (BookTrip).

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Lex console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lex/.

2. On the **Bots** page, choose **Create**.
3. On the **Create your Lex bot** page,
   - Choose **BookTrip** blueprint.
   - Leave the default bot name (BookTrip).
4. Choose **Create**. The console sends a series of requests to Amazon Lex to create the bot. Note the following:

5. The console shows the BookTrip bot. On the **Editor** tab, review the details of the preconfigured intents (BookCar and BookHotel).

6. Test the bot in the test window.

If you would like to use generative AI to optimize LexV2 bot creation and performance, please refer to this [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/generative-features.html)

If you wish to use AWS Bedrock Agents with a custom knowledge base—as part of your autonomous bot workflow, here are some guides that can help you [setup agents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents.html) and [knowledge base](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-create.html)

### 4.3 Lex Bot Configuration & Testing

Once you have successfully created the Lex bot following the documentations provided above, please make sure to add Agent Intent to your bot.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Lex console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lex/.

2. From the list of bots, choose the bot that you created, then from **Add languages** choose **View languages**.

3. Choose the language to add the intent to, then choose **Intents**.
4. Choose **Add intent**, give your intent a name, and then choose **Add**.
5. Add **Sample Utterances**

   ```
   Agent
   Can I talk to an agent
   Can I talk to a person
   Representative please
   Connect me to a person
   ```

   Feel free to add or remove utterances, but please keep it specific to the agent

6. Set up **Fulfillment** response<br/>
   - On successful fulfillment
     ```
     Okay, transferring you to a human agent.
     ```
   - In case of failure
     ```
     I'm sorry, but I couldn't connect you to a human agent. Please try again.
     ```

After creation, test your bot inside the AWS Lex UI and ensure that all basic and agent-related intents work as expected.

### 4.4 Collect Lex Bot Identifiers

Once your bot is ready, note the following identifiers:

- Bot name
- Bot ID
- Bot alias name
- Alias bot ID

You will enter these into your Webex Lex connector configuration.

### 4.5 IAM Policy and Permissions

To allow Lex and its integrations to function, attach these managed policies to your IAM user:

- AmazonLexFullAccess
- AmazonPollyReadOnlyAccess (required for text-to-speech features)​

For Bedrock/advanced integrations, you may to add extra policies. Please refer to this [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/bedrock-agent-intent-permissions.html) to learn more.

### 4.6 Create access keys

1. Use your AWS account ID or account alias, your IAM user name, and your password to sign in to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the navigation bar on the upper right, choose your user name, and then choose **Security credentials**.

3. In the **Access keys** section, choose **Create access key**. If you already have two access keys, this button is deactivated and you must delete an access key before you can create a new one.

4. On the **Access key best practices & alternatives** page, choose your use case to learn about additional options which can help you avoid creating a long-term access key. If you determine that your use case still requires an access key, choose **Other** and then choose **Next**.

5. (Optional) Set a description tag value for the access key. This adds a tag key-value pair to your IAM user. This can help you identify and update access keys later. The tag key is set to the access key id. The tag value is set to the access key description that you specify. When you are finished, choose **Create access key**.

6. On the **Retrieve access keys** page, choose either **Show** to reveal the value of your user's secret access key, or **Download .csv file**. This is your only opportunity to save your secret access key. After you've saved your secret access key in a secure location, choose **Done**.

Please save this Access Key and Secret Access Key very safely.
